- FIRST MOST IMPORTANT STEP SINCE PEOPLE DON'T READ: Check your es_extended fxmanifest version.  only 1.2+ is supported. So: 1.1.0 will NOT work!

Report hackers and hackwebsites please.

We have edited the original esx_inventoryhud resource from Trsak.

Your help is much appreciated in a pull request!

We did not make any of these scripts. We do not take any credits. Did we forget to mention you in the credits? Then let us know in our Discord server or create an issue!
